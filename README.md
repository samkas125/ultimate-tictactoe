# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
### What is Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe?
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is an expanded form of Tic-Tac-Toe that is played on a 9x9 board. It consists of a 3x3 grid of large squares, that each individually have a 3x3 grid of small cells within them. In this way, the game of Tic-Tac-Toe is played both on individual boxes, as well as on the overall board.

This is a python project that allows a user to play ultimate tic tac toe against another player. Currently working on training a reinforcement learning algorithm to train an AI that will be able to play ultimate tic tac toe.
